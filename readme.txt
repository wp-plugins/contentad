== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How quickly does it start working? =
The Content.ad Widget will start to work immediately; however, part of the optimization process involves learning which of your content performs the best. A certain number of impressions must be served before the widget is able to fully optimize and display the most effective content.

= Does Content.ad work on web sites in any language? =

Currently, the tool will work only on websites that are in the English language.

= Will the widget slow down my site? =

No. The content.ad widget is designed to load "asynchronously". This means your page will load independently of the widget script.

= I've configured my widget to display sponsored content but don't see any sponsored links appearing. =

Content.ad only displays sponsored content on approved domains. This means new sites could take 24 to 48 hours before sponsored content starts getting served. If for some reason your site is not approved to serve sponsored content, we will contact you and let you know why. Your Content.Ad account settings will indicate whether a domain has been approved.

= I still don’t see ads on my site? =

Content.ad related content sections are configured to only appear on post pages. Also make sure that you have javascript and cookies turned on.  Ads should not appear on the front page of your site (generally a WordPress page or list of post summaries).

= How do I control ad placement?=

Use the Content.Ad plugin widget settings. Hover over a widget name and you will see options Edit | Placement | Delete. Click on placement to indicate if you want the ads to appear before or after the post content.  Ads can also appear in your WordPress sidebars or footers. Use the WordPress widget.

= Can a I display ads on multiple blogs? =

Yes. You’ll need to tell Content.Ad that you have multiple domains. Each widget is associated with a domain. When you create a new widget there is an opportunity to add a domain.

= WordPress widgets and Content.Ad widgets oh my=

Content.Ad refers to their ads or “links to related content” as widgets. These are different than WordPress widgets.

= Can I display Content.Ad content in a sidebar or footer? =

Yes. Set the placement for a Content.Ad widget to “widget”. In your WordPress widget settings drag the Content.Ad widget into your sidebar or footer area.

The Content.Ad widget will display content from Content.Ad if 1) the current page is a post,  2)  placement for at least one Content.Ad widget set to "widget", and 3) exclusions for category or tag do not apply for this widget.
